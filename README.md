## user-apps.sh
This is for Ubuntu to tell you what apps a user has installed.
It uses apt-mark --show-manual - base system apps = user apps

## synclient-palm.sh
My laptop wouldn't turn off the touchpad when typing, so this will enable palm detect. This uses synclient.

## xinput-palm.sh
My laptop wouldn't turn off the touchpad when typing, so this will enable palm detect. This uses xinput instead of the synclient.
